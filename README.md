# WebApp for Prediction of Flight Fare

## Overview 

This is basically a webapp deployed on heroku platform for predicting flight fares. The dataset I used for this project is from Kaggle's flight price prediction dataset. By giving input such as Source, Destination, Arrival and Departure time you will get the predicted output as a price of your journey. The model is trained using Random Forest algorithm which is named as ```random_forest_model.pkl```

## Motivation

Predicting flight prices without having proper idea about particular airline company is near too impossible, specially when you want to book any flight real quick. Using Machine Learning approach it becomes quite easy as the model predicts that how much you need to spent on your flight expenses by getting rid of all unnecessary calculations and brain scratching thoughts. From user's point of view this is somehow proves to be a profitable project model as user can select from a wide range of airline companies whichever of their choice is and decide budget for their ongoing journey without spending anything extra.
